# Clustering_techniques_R

Project 1
The objective of project 1 is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and
real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques

Task 1
Data sets, “Data1.csv”, “Data2.csv”, “Data3.csv”, “Data4.csv”, “Data5.csv”, “Data6.csv”,
“Data7.csv”, “Data8.csv” contain the data points and their respective class information.
For each of the datasets follow the below steps
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation
metrics
3. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
original class
4. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
class allocated by the clustering algorithm

Task 2
The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries
together
2. Use Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Report the best clustering solution. Give a detailed list of all the groups and the
countries included within the groups
4. Generate three different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points
according to the group. Example: “Life expectancy vs GDP”, “Infant Mortality vs
GDP”, etc.

Submission Format
1. Submit all the solutions as an R markdown file
2. Include texts to explain the solution
3. Include equations for the evaluation metrics in the R markdown file
4. Use packages in R that provide functions for different clustering methods and
cluster validation
5. Students can also create their own custom functions if necessary
6. This is a group effort
7. Only one member from each group needs to submit the solution
8. Submit the solution by Nov 24
